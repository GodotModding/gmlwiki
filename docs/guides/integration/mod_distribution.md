# Mod Distribution

Created mods are just plain `.zip` files, which makes it easy for users to unzip and inspect for malicious code.

To let your community distribute these zips, you can either

- set up [Steam Workshop](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop/implementation) if you are on Steam, or
- [contact the Thunderstore team](https://pages.thunderstore.io/p/contact-us) to create a category for you (or let the community do that)
